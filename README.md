# IT490-Group-4-Project
Online gaming is ever expanding. Whether it’s huge, Massive Multiplayer Online games, or simple games
just made to pass the time, all different kinds of people turn to the internet in search of entertainment. For
our project, our goal is to contribute to the online gaming community with our own arcade-style,
web-based shooter game called Professor in Space that will entice users to beat not only their own high
scores, but other users’ as well. The video-game will be hosted on a secure, sleek, and cutting-edge
website that will aid in stream-lining the user experience for everyone. Players will need the utmost
dedication and precision to lead the ranks in Professor in Space.
